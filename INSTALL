1) Download sources from Github.com
2) Download WoW Icons from "Downloads" section (https://github.com/Shadez/wowhead/downloads)
3) Unzip icons.7z to "static/images/wow/" directory (you should have "static/wow/icons/tiny/" folder after extracting, for example).
4) Rename "includes/configs/*.php.default" to "*.php" and edit WoWConfig.php file (read comments about $WoW_Path and $Static_Url varables!).
5) Change 2 lines in .htaccess file:

      ErrorDocument 404 /wowhead/index.php?error=404
      ErrorDocument 403 /wowhead/index.php?error=403
      
   to your correct path (replace or delete "wowhead" from path).
6) Upload SQLs from sql/wowhead_rXX.7z archive into WORLD(!) database (mangos, for example).
7) Upload all necessary SQL updates from sql/updates folder (revision of update must be > than latest full DB dump in "sql" folder).

You can move "static" directory anywhere, but do not forget to change WoWConfig::$Static_Url value to new path.
